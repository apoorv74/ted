"Raymond Wang","Inventor","How germs travel on planes — and how we can stop them","Raymond Wang is only 17 years old, but he's already helping to build a healthier future. Using fluid dynamics, he created computational simulations of how air moves on airplanes, and what he found is disturbing — when a person sneezes on a plane, the airflow actually helps to spread pathogens to other passengers. Wang shares an unforgettable animation of how a sneeze travels inside a plane cabin as well as his prize-winning solution: a small, fin-shaped device that increases fresh airflow in airplanes and redirects pathogen-laden air out of circulation.","Raymond Wang won the top prize in the 2015 Intel Science and Engineering Fair for his invention that circulates fresh air on planes and reduces transmission of germs between passengers.","https://ted.com/talks/raymond_wang_how_germs_travel_on_planes_and_how_we_can_stop_them","not available","https://ted.com/speakers/raymond_wang","Dec 2015","Informative, Ingenious"

A modified browser for TED Talks
================

TED Talks - We all love them, and they have been an important resource of knowledge sharing in the last decade. Though [TED](https://ted.com) maintains a beautiful website and has various options where a user can drill down to a topic of his/her choice and view the talk, sometimes the data generated by viewers watching this talk can complement this search.

The idea here is to get the best content to as many people as possible, even when they are new to TED.
